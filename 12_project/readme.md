# Try Something Else...

With the remaining class time, you're going to be challenged to apply what you've learned in a more self guided way. This doesn't mean you're being thrown into the deep end. On the contrary, the instructor is here to support you, answer questions, and help you make progress.

However, the point of this section of the class is three fold:

1. It is a chance for you to explore something that you actually care about, rather than a topic selected for you.
2. It is a chance to practice in a realistic way. Most of the time when you want to use code for something, you'll be figuring things out on your own.
3. People progress at different rates through a fast paced class like this one. Some of you are probably ready to tackle bigger projects, and some probably want more time to go back and practice the stuff from day one!

Here are a few suggestions for possible exploration during this time:

0. Finish any of the exercises you weren't able to complete in the allotted class time. Even if you've seen the solution, writing the code yourself will definitely help solidify the concepts.

1. Add tests or type checking / annotations to a package or module that you're responsible for at work.
    * Everyone will thank you.

2. Make a slightly more difficult text-based game: tic-tac-toe is a good choice. Some fun/challenging parts of this:
    * Modeling the board as some kind of data.
    * Trying to design an AI that plays well.
    * Working with user input.
    * Stretch goal: make a graphical interface using something like TKinter, [here's a tutorial](https://www.pythonpool.com/tic-tac-toe-python/)!

3. Connect Python to a SQL database.
    * Super realistic.
    * Get real data from your real database, then use Python/Pandas/Jupyter to manipulate and explore that data.
    * Create an ETL job, from SQL -> CSV or vice versa, or make a derived table in an ETL job that starts and ends with a SQL.
    * Explore ways to automate that process using something like [cron](https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux) for Linux/Unix systems or [Task Scheduler](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-automated-task-using-task-scheduler-windows-10) on Windows.
    * Use SQL Alchemy! Here is a [tutorial](https://zetcode.com/db/sqlalchemy/intro/)

4. Make a web scraper. 
    * Super realistic, a LOT of data for real ML projects is collected this way.
    * More practice working with text data... love it or hate it, processing text is very common!
    * Here's [a tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-python-using-beautiful-soup/) using Beautiful Soup and the requests library!

5. Learn how to do an "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA) in Python.
    * Your instructor has materials that can help you get started.
    * Kaggle.com has beginner datasets.
    * `pandas` and `pyspark` are great libraries to start with.

6. Whatever else has been on your mind... 
    * Generative AI?
    * An API you've been curious about?
    * The world is your oyster.

## Additionally:

1. You may work in small groups or alone, whichever you prefer.
2. Don't agonize over what to do, just try something that seems interesting!
3. Tell your instructor what you're going to work on and they'll give you advice about how to get started!
