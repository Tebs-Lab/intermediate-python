# Write Tests Exercise

In this folder is a Python file with 2 functions, each of which has at least one error. Meaning: the function does not behave the way it's docstring says it should for at least one use case. Your goal is to write a test suite that identifies the error, and then fix the bug in the code.

You may use `pytest` or `unittest`.

## Notes and Hints:

* There ARE indeed intentional errors in both functions.
    * The solution test file explains them, the solution functions file fixes them.
    * We are not telling you how many there are or what they are because a huge part of testing is coming up with test cases that fail!
    * In the real world, you won't know what errors are in your code either...

* First, write some simple tests that handle common cases.
* Then, explore the edge cases.
* Remember: "red, green, refactor" 
    * Don't change the code until you've written a test case that proves the code is wrong.
