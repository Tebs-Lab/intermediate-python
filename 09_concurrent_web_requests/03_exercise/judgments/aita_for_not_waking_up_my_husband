==========================
The Situation: My husbands alarm goes off for work every morning at 6:30am and again at 6:40am. He turns it off but then rolls over and goes back to sleep so at 6:45am I wake him up and he gets ready for work. A couple nights ago we had a pretty bad argument and we went to bed upset with each other. The next morning his 2 alarms went off and I chose not to wake him at 6:45 cause I simply didnâ€™t want to speak with him. Anyway, he ended up waking himself at 7:15am and was 15 minutes late to work by the time he got ready. He blames me for making him late for work and was pretty upset. AITA?
