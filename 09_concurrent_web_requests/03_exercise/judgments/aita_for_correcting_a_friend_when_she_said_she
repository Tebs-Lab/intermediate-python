==========================
The Situation: My friend told a story about re-homing her cat because it wouldn’t stop going to the bathroom on her bed. 

She said she put the cat in its carrier and left it outside the door of a local salon before they opened. She said she checked in later, and one of the girls had decided to adopt the cat, so the re-homing was a success. 

I told her that what she did was not re-homing, and that what she had actually done was dump her cat. I told her that re-homing involved finding an owner and vetting them in advance. 

She got very angry at me for “judging” her. Am I the asshole?
