==========================
The Situation: TLDR; I’m taking a day away from my husband and son to be comfortable with going back to work. Husband has never had a day alone with son so I asked him to try to figure it out but I’ll be available if needed. He told his mother to come and help. I said no. He thinks I’m ridiculous. 

I (30F) and my husband (33M) welcomed our first child this past September. I have been fortunate to be on maternity leave but that ends next week. My husband had 2 months off and has been working full time since. He’s off on Sundays and Mondays. I have never left my son except to go to a wedding in December but we were only away for 3 of his wake hours. My in laws watched over him and everything was fine. 

I go back to work next week and my son will be attending day care. My husband is off this entire week and we’ve just been taking a staycation. I told my husband though I want one day on my own to get more comfortable from being away from our baby and that I want him to have the day with the baby on his own. He has never been alone with him for more than an hour. He is a good father though and will help out when needed. But he has never been there for the full blown cries and fussiness while having to take care of the house. 

A few days ago, we went to a friends house and our son was screaming bloody hell. Whenever I held him, he would calm down. Whenever my husband held him, he would just scream and cry even louder. So my husband just passed him along to me. I was getting frustrated cause I just wanted to relax with friends and he couldn’t calm him down for a minute. 

Today he tells me that his mom will be coming to help out. I asked him to tell her never mind cause he should be able to do it on his own. He called me ridiculous and it shouldn’t matter but I think it really does. I can’t be bothered at work unless absolutely necessary so I wanted t this to be our “trial”. His mom will also be working on Mondays so it’s not like she will be available to help out then. His mom is taking his side but of course she will cause our son is her only grandson. 

So AITA for telling husband to figure it out and step up? 

This is my first AITA post and I’m frustrated just writing this so if you need more details to decide, just let me know and I’ll respond. 

ETA- I had a c section and I exclusively breastfed so I physically could not leave the baby in the first 2 months. My lactation consultant told me not to pump until after 2 months as I needed to establish my milk supply. He took care of my while I took care of baby. He doesn’t do NOTHING. When I started pumping, husband was already at work. Husband does do feedings now. 

ETA2 - this isn’t a punch towards his mother. I adore her. It’s really about him being independent with the baby. She helps us and I always appreciate it. Idk why yall think I’m spiteful. 

ETA3 - When my husband is home, I do separate myself from them by going to a different room. But he does often come to the room for help. I’m not just dropping him off.
